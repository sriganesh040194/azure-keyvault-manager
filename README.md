## 🛠️ Installation and Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone <repository-url>

Ensure Azure CLI is installed and authenticated:

```bash
# Install Azure CLI (if not already installed)
# See: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli

# Login to Azure
az login

# Verify your subscription
az account show

# Set default subscription (if needed)
az account set --subscription "Your Subscription Name"
```

### 4. Generate Code (if needed)

If you make changes to models with JSON serialization:

```bash
dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```

## 🚀 Running the Application

### Development Mode
```bash
# Start the development server
flutter run -d chrome --web-port 8080

# Or for hot reload during development
flutter run -d chrome --web-port 8080 --hot
```

### Production Build
```bash
# Build for production
flutter build web

# Serve the built application
cd build/web
python -m http.server 8080  # or use any web server
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:8080`

## 🧪 Testing

### Run Unit Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
flutter test

# Run specific test files
flutter test test/azure_cli_service_test.dart
flutter test test/input_validator_test.dart

# Run tests with coverage
flutter test --coverage
```

### Run Integration Tests
```bash
# Run integration tests (ensure Azure CLI is set up)
flutter test integration_test/
```

## 🔐 Security Considerations

### Authentication Security
- **CLI Integration**: Uses existing Azure CLI authentication - no additional tokens required
- **Session Management**: Automatic session validation and timeout handling
- **Secure Transmission**: All CLI operations use Azure's secure authentication

### Input Security
- **Validation**: All user inputs are validated before processing
- **Sanitization**: Command injection prevention through input sanitization
- **Allow-lists**: Only pre-approved Azure CLI commands are executed

### Data Security
- **Output Redaction**: Sensitive information is automatically redacted from logs and UI
- **Secure Logging**: Security events are logged separately with appropriate detail levels
- **Memory Protection**: Sensitive data is cleared from memory when no longer needed

### Network Security
- **HTTPS Only**: All network communications use HTTPS
- **CORS Protection**: Proper Cross-Origin Resource Sharing configuration
- **Token Validation**: JWT tokens are properly validated and verified

## 🎯 Implemented Azure CLI Commands

The application currently supports the following Azure CLI operations:

### Key Vault Operations
- `az keyvault list` - List Key Vaults
- `az keyvault create` - Create new Key Vault
- `az keyvault delete` - Delete Key Vault
- `az keyvault show` - Get Key Vault details
- `az keyvault update` - Update Key Vault properties

### Secret Operations
- `az keyvault secret list` - List secrets in a Key Vault
- `az keyvault secret show` - Get secret details
- `az keyvault secret set` - Create or update a secret
- `az keyvault secret delete` - Delete a secret

### Key Operations (Coming Soon)
- `az keyvault key list` - List keys
- `az keyvault key create` - Create new key
- `az keyvault key delete` - Delete key

### Certificate Operations (Coming Soon)

### Access Policy Operations (Coming Soon)
- `az keyvault set-policy` - Set access policies
- `az keyvault delete-policy` - Delete access policies

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Authentication Issues
- **Problem**: "Azure CLI not authenticated"
- **Solution**: Run `az login` and ensure you're signed in to the correct tenant

#### Permission Issues
- **Problem**: "Insufficient permissions to access Key Vault"
- **Solution**: Ensure your account has Key Vault Contributor role or appropriate access policies

#### CLI Issues
- **Problem**: "Azure CLI not found"
- **Solution**: Install Azure CLI from the official Microsoft documentation
- **Problem**: "Azure CLI command failed"
- **Solution**: Verify Azure CLI is installed and updated to the latest version

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging by setting the log level in `lib/core/logging/app_logger.dart`:

```dart
static final Logger _logger = Logger(
  level: Level.debug, // Add this line for debug output
  printer: PrettyPrinter(
    // ... existing configuration
  ),
);
```

### Check Application Health

The application includes built-in health checks:

1. **Azure CLI Status**: Dashboard shows if Azure CLI is installed and authenticated
2. **Authentication Status**: Clear indicators for login status and session validity
3. **Permission Checks**: Automatic validation of Key Vault access permissions
4. **Subscription Info**: Display current Azure subscription and tenant information
